1. R chunk and Python chunk notes

You can create an pRChunk for an R chunk and a pPChunk for a Python chunk. The “Chunk & Graph: Make Chunk List” stamp generates a tag like ＜chunk:tagname＞.
These tags can be used to reference R chunks, Python chunks, Mermaid diagrams, or Graphviz code.
Please do not insert tags in the middle of a sentence.
＜chunk:tagname＞


2. Rendered Preview in Text Pane(R chunks, Mermaid diagrams, and Graphviz only)

You can check the results of the code executed within an R chunk in the Preview screen. Similarly, the results of Mermaid and Graphviz code can also be displayed. However, this is not possible for Python.
