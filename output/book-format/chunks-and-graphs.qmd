1. R chunk and Python chunk notes

You can create a pRChunk for an R chunk and a pPChunk for a Python chunk. The “Chunk & Graph: Make Chunk List” stamp generates a tag like ＜Lang:Tag Label➡️Figure Label＞.
These tags can be used to reference R chunks, Python chunks, Mermaid diagrams, or Graphviz code.
Please do not insert tags in the middle of a sentence.

If tags called in your notes are changed or deleted, the warning is shown.
you can suppress the warning with  `$SuppresTagDetectWaring` in the project container note.


2. Rendered Preview in Text Pane(R chunks, Mermaid diagrams, and Graphviz only)

You can check the results of the code executed within an R chunk in the Preview screen. Similarly, the results of Mermaid and Graphviz code can also be displayed. However, this is not possible for Python.
