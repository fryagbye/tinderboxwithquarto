1. Make notes with Prototype pNote and pSubnote

    pNote is for Sections and pSubnote is for Subsections.
Please set the Prototype of pNote to level 1 and pSubnote below level.


 * When creating a note, please enter "#pNote" or "#pSubnote" following the title. (or apply the pNote Prototype or pSubnote to notes you make )

    e.g. Note title -> わが輩は猫である#pSubnote


     * The note title (`$Name`) is the header for pNote or pSubnote.



 * Depending on the hierarchy level, the level of the header also changes.

     e.g. If the title of pSubnote in level 2 depth is "わが輩は猫である", it will be output as follows when exporting.
     > \#\# わが輩は猫である

2. Index.qmd

    In the quarto book format, **only one index.qmd is required**,  `$IsIndexqmd` of the index.qmd is set to `true`.
You can make the note for index.qmd with the pIndexQmd Prototype or make `$IsIndexqmd` of pNote  `true`.
