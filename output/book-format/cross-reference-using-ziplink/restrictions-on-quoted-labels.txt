* The label before change or deletion remains because it cannot be detected even if the quoted label name is changed or deleted.



* Cross-ref detection is carried out by regular expression. If it is executed in the middle of input, it will be duplicated with a short label.

In this case, if necessary, delete the quoted label name in Stamp and perform the detection manually by following the steps below.


1. Labels: Clear Cross-Reference List（Delete all citation labels under the Reference List.）



2. Labels: Make Cross-Reference List（Re-detect the quoted label.）
