## Front Matter and Subnote



1. pFrontmatterRevealjs

    
    This is a qmd file that contains a Front Matter. When you export, it has descendants' contents.


2. pSubnoteRevealjs

    This is a dummy file for pFrontmatterRevealjs. The markdown level depends on the indent level and `$OutlineBaseControl` of the subproject folder.

```
$OutlineDepthBase * "#" + $OutlineBaseControl(collect(ancestors,$Path)[-1]))
```



3. Quote chunk code blocks

    You can chunk code blocks with a quote tag like the one below from a child note (pRChunk or pPChunk).
    <Lang:chunknotename>
