# Part in Book format {#sec-part-in-book-format }

For Part, please refer to [Quarto's "Book Structure" reference](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-structure.html).

pNote is compatible with quarto's **Part** or **Chapter**.

If pNote is at the bottom of pNote, the top pNote will be Part (Part ○), and the lower pNote will be Chapter (Chapter ○). You can place pNote at hierarchical level 2 only if you are under pNote of hierarchy level 1. In this case, the hierarchy level and header level are one different, so the header level is set based on the user attribute `$OutlineDepthBase`.

pNote, which is treated as a Part, is turned on (`true`) for `$Is_Part_qmd`. The lower pNote contains the export file name (e.g. filename.qmd) of the pNote, which is Part, in `$Part_file`.
If a Part note is empty, only the title (`$Name`) of the note is reflected in _quarto.yml, as shown in the **"Dice"** in the example below. 
If the dice.qmd is not empty, the part title (as a level one header) as well as some introductory content for the part. 

```{.yml} 
#_quarto.yml
chapters:
  - index.qmd
  - preface.qmd
  - part: "Dice" # if $Text("Dice").wordCount == 0 
  chapters: 
    - basics.qmd
    - packages.qmd
```

```{.yml}
#_quarto.yml
chapters:
  - index.qmd
  - preface.qmd
  - part: dice.qmd # if $Text("Dice").wordCount >0 
    chapters: 
      - basics.qmd
      - packages.qmd
```

The figure below shows the export example when Part is supported and the output result of _quarto.yml.
